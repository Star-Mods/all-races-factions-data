Param/Value/lib_03673618_1EEB4501=Hello! Thanks for playing my mod!<n/><n/>This is the first mod i've released, most of my modding experience came from playing around in the galaxy editor for fun. I go by Mircea Hinestraza online. I am a guy who loves to play around with cool ideas but kinda struggles putting them into paper so its impressive i actually got anything published this time.<n/>If you havent noticed yet, this mod's creation is directly inspired by <c val="80FFFF">Scion Custom Races</c> by <c val="FFFF80">Solstice</c>, and other custom race mods that have been keeping this game fresh throughout all this time.<n/><n/>This mod is still largely unfinished and i will do my best to keep it updated and in functioning quality, the mod itself is a dirty mess behind the screens so its likely i will re-make it from scratch once i have a stable vision for the project, for hygene's sake and for compatibility with other mods and custom maps. <n/><n/>I am not very good creating audiovisual assets so most of them will be ripped and modified assets by other creators, so far without their explicit consent, though most of them are ok with it or inactive, but nevertheless here's a link to the pastebin in case you havent seen it in the mod description. I will do my best to keep every creator properly credited as well as all those who have assisted me thus far.<n/><c val="FF0000">Credits:</c> <c val="FFFF80">pastebin.com/W0mCXjf7</c><n/>

[Subject to change if necessary].<n/><n/>- The buildings on the second row are your productions structures, the <c val="FFFF80">Garrison</c>, the <c val="FFFF80">Assembly </c>and the <c val="FFFF80">Hangar</c>. Assigned to infantry, Mech and Air respectively, below them you have their specific tech structures you need to build next to progress further down the tech tree.<n/><n/>- The <c val="FF8000">Requisition Field</c> is the orange circle that surrounds the Myco-Processors and the (green circles around) Myco-Choirs and Greater Processors; its analogous to the protoss pylon energy field, however, it doesn't work in exactly the same manner. Some units and structures require the abilities to be cast within a requisition field, and all buildings, including some units, require a requisition field source nearby in order to function.<n/><n/>- All production buildings can be upgraded to a "super" variant that unlocks more advanced units and produces 25% faster, however, they require a <c val="80FF00">super requisition source (the green ones) </c>around them in order to function, in other words, a Myco-Choir and a Greater Processor nearby. You can upgrade Myco-Processors within super requisition sources into Greater Processors to expand the area. <n/><n/>- Prospectors [Name subject to change] are your main worker unit, they are used to build MycoChoirs, but can also transform into a number of defensive buildings that the MycoChoir is unable to deploy (for balance's sake).<n/><n/>- Servitors are your basic unit, they start off unable to attack air and only have slightly less health and DPS than a marine, however, they are smaller, cheaper, and can pack more of them in a smaller area, increasing their volume of fire. You can upgrade their health and equip them with missile launchers in the Bio-Synth Facility<n/><n/>- Cremators are an army defense unit, they have decent range and DPS and do damage in a line. While not nearly as mobile as hellions they can be upgraded to have a shield capable of intercepting missiles<n/><n/>- The Censer is your basic means of Bio healing, once their signature ability is enabled, they will become stationary and heal units in a decent radius, instead of bleeding energy, each heal will deplete energy, so be not afraid of using them.<n/><n/>- The warden airship is your basic means of transport, it can hold 2 extra units than the every other transport and it is capable of shielding and locking down enemy units at the cost of draining its own energy. - Hailstorm Turrets are your basic means of base defense, they can air and ground units, however they have separate weapons that work differently. The hellstorm missile pods are its basic readily available ground attack, which fires slow moving AOE projectiles that can be dodged by a unit that moves fast enough [Subject to change], <c val="FFFF80">The hailstorm dont start out with the anti-air weapon enabled, you have to enable it by researching it in the Satelite Uplink</c> [Subject to change]<n/><n/>- The Sat-Com Tower is a caster building useful for base defense, can reveal enemy units, repair mechanical units and summon small drones to help defend the base in case of emergencies. <n/><n/>- The Karolean Walker is your giant mech unit, slow but powerful long range attacks. Buffs friendly units by giving them +1 armor and +2 range directly under them, use them along the rest of your army for stronger pushes. Reveals iself while attacking.
